This project is a basic home security system that detects motion and alerts the user. It uses a small device called an Arduino Uno to control the system. The setup includes a motion sensor, LED light, buzzer, and wires all connected through a breadboard. It will be explained in deeper detail below.

## When the motion sensor detects movement (like someone walking past for example), it will:

- Turns on an LED light
- Plays a sound through a buzzer
- Displays a message saying "Motion detected!" on a computer screen
- When the motion stops, everything turns off and the message changes to "Motion stopped!"
